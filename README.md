# RNR 620 University of Arizona
Code and data used and required for RNR 620 (Spring 2020). The code for the final assignment is called "Assignment_5.R".

### Data
All required data for analysis can be found in this folder.
For data frames that have date data associated with them, it is best to download the .RData files so no additional formatting is needed.

### Shapefiles
All required shapefiles to plot a distribuiton map of White-tailed deer in Chiricahua National Monument in 2017 can be found in this folder. They are compressed in a zip-folder. The script downloads this folder directly from GitHub, extracts it, and accesses the shapefiles for mapping. However, manually downloading and extracting is possible as well. In that case the script has to be modified by the end user to load the right files (and right directory).
